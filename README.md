# BookSearch

## Description

The main purpose of this project was to update the code to change from a API routes to graphql.  It was quite difficult since the graphql needed to be implemented and I had to look through the code to decide which lines of code needed to be replaced or deleted.  It was really confusing trying to follow each route and make sure there was no left over code which would break the page. After some trial and error I was able to get the server working and the routes working correctly
